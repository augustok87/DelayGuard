## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: Do I need technical skills to set up DelayGuard?**
A: Absolutely not. Installation takes 30 seconds (one-click), and the setup wizard guides you through the 3-4 simple configuration steps. Most users are fully set up in under 5 minutes.

### **Q: Which shipping carriers do you support?**
A: We support all major carriers: UPS, FedEx, DHL, USPS, Canada Post, Royal Mail, Australia Post, and 100+ regional carriers worldwide. If we don't support your carrier, let us know—we'll add it.

### **Q: How do you calculate delay alerts?**
A: You set a custom threshold (e.g., "alert me if an order hasn't shipped within 2 days"). DelayGuard monitors carrier tracking data and alerts you the moment this threshold is crossed. It's smart enough to account for weekends, holidays, and carrier processing times.

### **Q: Will this work with my fulfillment service (3PL)?**
A: Yes! As long as your 3PL provides tracking numbers to Shopify (which most do), DelayGuard will monitor those orders automatically. No special setup needed.

### **Q: Can I customize the notification messages?**
A: Absolutely. You can create unlimited custom email and SMS templates (Professional plan and above) with your brand voice, logo, and messaging. We provide proven templates to start with.

### **Q: What happens when I hit my order limit?**
A: We'll send you a friendly reminder before you hit your limit. You can upgrade anytime with one click, and there's no data loss or service interruption. No surprise charges—ever.

### **Q: Do you offer refunds?**
A: Yes! We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked. If DelayGuard isn't right for you, just email us and we'll refund your first payment immediately.

### **Q: How is this different from Shopify's built-in order tracking?**
A: Shopify shows you tracking info after you look for it. DelayGuard proactively alerts you the moment something goes wrong, includes customer communication tools, provides analytics on carrier performance, and automates the entire delay management workflow. It's like having a dedicated shipping manager on your team.

### **Q: Is my customer data safe?**
A: Yes. We only access order and tracking data (never payment info). All data is encrypted, we're GDPR/CCPA compliant, and we never sell or share your data with third parties. Your trust is our most valuable asset.

### **Q: Can I try it free?**
A: Yes! Every plan includes a 14-day free trial with full access to all features (no credit card required). You can explore the entire app risk-free.

### **Q: What if I have multiple Shopify stores?**
A: Each store needs its own DelayGuard subscription. However, Enterprise customers get volume discounts for multi-store setups. Contact us for custom pricing.
