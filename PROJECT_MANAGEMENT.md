# DelayGuard Project Management & Roadmap

## Project Overview

DelayGuard is a Shopify app that proactively detects shipping delays and alerts customers, reducing support tickets by 20-40%. This document outlines the complete project roadmap, development phases, legal considerations, and ongoing maintenance strategy.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation & Planning (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal**: Establish project foundation and validate market opportunity

#### Week 1: Research & Validation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Market Research**
  - ✅ Analyzed competitor apps on Shopify App Store (e.g., ShipAware, Parcel Panel, AfterShip, Shipway, Smart Notifications)
  - ✅ Identified gaps: Most apps are reactive (post-purchase tracking); limited proactive delay detection and automation for small merchants
  - ✅ Researched carrier API capabilities: ShipEngine supports delay detection via status codes ("DELAYED", "EXCEPTION"); USPS has "OnTime" boolean; UPS/FedEx provide event/status codes for delays
  - ✅ Surveyed potential customers via X sentiment analysis: Common pain points include delays causing support tickets (30-40% reduction desired), payout holds, customer complaints; demand for proactive alerts and better communication

- [x] **Technical Research**
  - ✅ Evaluated Shopify App development requirements: Use OAuth for auth, webhooks for real-time updates, GraphQL for data fetching; focus on solving merchant problems with App Store guidelines emphasizing quality and value
  - ✅ Researched ShipEngine API: Unified tracking for 50+ carriers, delay detection via status/ETA comparisons; free tier (10K requests/month), paid starts at $50/month for higher volumes
  - ✅ Assessed notification service providers: SendGrid (free 100 emails/day, paid from $20/month for 40K emails); Twilio (pay-per-use ~$0.0083/SMS, volume discounts)
  - ✅ Reviewed hosting options: Vercel recommended for serverless Shopify apps (free tier scales to 10K+ users); outperforms Heroku (limited scaling) and AWS (complex for solos) in ease and cost for 2025

- [x] **Business Planning**
  - ✅ Finalized pricing strategy: Freemium ($7/month Pro for unlimited; aligns with 2025 averages of $9-99/month for shipping apps)
  - ✅ Created financial projections: Bootstrapped model targeting $35-70 MRR Month 3, scaling to $1,050-2,100 MRR by Month 12 (based on similar apps reaching $1M ARR)
  - ✅ Defined target customer segments: Small-medium merchants (1-50 employees, $10K-$1M revenue; 680K potential in Shopify's 1.7M+ stores); personas: price-sensitive dropshippers, growing brands needing automation
  - ✅ Developed go-to-market strategy: Organic focus (App Store SEO, content marketing on shipping tips, X/Reddit engagement, Product Hunt launch); budgeted $0-100 initially

#### Week 2: Project Setup
- [ ] **Development Environment**
  - Set up Shopify Partner account and development store
  - Install and configure development tools (Node.js, Shopify CLI)
  - Create project repository and development workflow
  - Set up project management tools (Trello, Notion, or similar)

- [ ] **Legal & Compliance**
