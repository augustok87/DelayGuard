## ⚠️ **Critical Issues Remaining (40% to Complete)**

### **1. Performance Hook Tests - 6 FAILING**
- **Problem**: Performance monitoring functionality not working as expected
- **Impact**: Memory usage, FPS tracking, console logging not functioning
- **Files**: `src/hooks/__tests__/usePerformance.test.ts`
- **Status**: Tests written but implementation needs fixing

### **2. TypeScript Errors in Dashboard Components - BLOCKING COVERAGE**
- **Problem**: Dashboard components using outdated Polaris APIs
- **Impact**: Prevents coverage collection, blocks 80%+ coverage goal
- **Files**: 
  - `src/components/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`
  - `src/components/EnhancedDashboard.tsx`
  - `src/components/ThemeCustomizer.tsx`
- **Status**: Major refactoring needed for Polaris compatibility

### **3. Coverage Collection - INCOMPLETE**
- **Current**: 13.98% overall coverage
- **Target**: 80%+ coverage
- **Blocker**: TypeScript errors preventing coverage collection
- **Status**: Working for tested components, blocked by dashboard components

### **4. Integration & E2E Tests - NOT WORKING**
- **Problem**: ESM module parsing errors
- **Impact**: Integration and E2E tests not running
- **Status**: Need Jest configuration updates for ESM support
