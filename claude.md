## PROJECT OVERVIEW

### What is DelayGuard?
DelayGuard is a Shopify app that helps merchants manage shipping delays and retain customers. It detects delays using 3 configurable rules and sends proactive notifications to customers.

### Current Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Remix
- **Backend**: Node.js, Remix (full-stack)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **APIs**:
  - Shopify Admin API (GraphQL)
  - ShipEngine API (carrier tracking)
  - SendGrid (email notifications)
- **Hosting**: TBD (likely Shopify App Bridge on Vercel/Railway)

### Current Architecture
- 3-tab structure:
  1. **Dashboard**: Settings, stats, delay detection rules
  2. **Delay Alerts**: List of current delays with enhanced cards
  3. **Orders**: All orders with tracking status

### Current Shopify Permissions
- `read_orders`
- `read_fulfillments`

### Permissions Needed for Phase 1-2
- `read_products` (to show line items)
- `read_customers` (for customer intelligence)

### Permissions Needed for Phase 3+
- `write_discounts` (for apology discount generation)

---

## BUSINESS CONTEXT

### Development Timeline
1. **Phase 1 & 2** (CURRENT): Implement before Shopify App Store submission
2. **Phase 3**: Launch as premium/enterprise tier feature
3. **Phase 4 & 5**: Future expansion (post-revenue)

### Target Customers
- Shopify merchants (small to medium businesses)
- 100-10,000 orders per month
- Care about customer retention and lifetime value

### Competitive Positioning
Shifting from "delay alerts" to "customer retention intelligence platform"

**Old value prop**: "Get alerts when orders are delayed"
**New value prop**: "Turn shipping delays into customer loyalty wins. Reduce churn by 35%."

### Pricing Strategy (Phase 3+)
- **Free**: Basic alerts only
- **Premium ($49/mo)**: Discount generation + basic workflows
- **Enterprise ($149/mo)**: Advanced workflows + analytics + priority support

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

**CRITICAL: This workflow is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Follow it for EVERY feature implementation.**

### The TDD-First Development Cycle

Every feature MUST follow this exact sequence:

#### 1. READ & UNDERSTAND (15-30 minutes)
   - ‚úÖ Read IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for the specific phase/feature
   - ‚úÖ Read DEEP_DIVE_UX_UI_RESEARCH.md for UX context
   - ‚úÖ Understand the acceptance criteria
   - ‚úÖ Identify which files need to be modified

#### 2. WRITE TESTS FIRST (TDD - Test-Driven Development)
   **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Write tests BEFORE writing implementation code!**

   ```bash
   # Create or update test file FIRST
   # Example: src/tests/unit/components/NewComponent.test.tsx

   # Write failing tests that describe the desired behavior
   # Tests should cover:
   # - Happy path (feature works as expected)
   # - Edge cases (empty data, null values, etc.)
   # - Error cases (API failures, validation errors)
   # - UI states (loading, error, success)
   ```

   **Why TDD?**
   - Forces you to think about requirements BEFORE coding
   - Ensures comprehensive test coverage
   - Prevents "forgetting" to write tests later
   - Makes refactoring safer

#### 3. IMPLEMENT THE FEATURE
   - Write the minimal code to make tests pass
   - Follow existing patterns in the codebase
   - Keep business logic separate from UI components
   - Use TypeScript strict mode (no `any` types)

#### 4. RUN TESTS CONTINUOUSLY
   ```bash
   # Run tests as you code
   npm test -- ComponentName.test.tsx --watch

   # All tests should pass before proceeding
   ```

#### 5. FIX LINTING ERRORS
   **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Fix linting BEFORE considering the feature done!**

   ```bash
   # Check for linting errors
   npm run lint

   # Auto-fix what can be auto-fixed
   npm run lint:fix

   # OR run ESLint directly
   npx eslint . --ext .js,.ts,.tsx --fix

   # Manually fix remaining errors:
   # - Escape apostrophes in JSX: ' becomes &apos;
   # - Fix space-before-function-paren
   # - Remove unused imports
   ```

   **Common ESLint Errors:**
   - `react/no-unescaped-entities`: Escape apostrophes with `&apos;`
   - `space-before-function-paren`: Add/remove space before `()`
   - `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`: Replace `any` with proper types

#### 6. VERIFY EVERYTHING WORKS
   ```bash
   # Run all affected tests
   npm test -- ComponentName.test.tsx

   # Check dev server is running
   curl http://localhost:3000

   # Verify TypeScript compilation
   npm run type-check
   ```

#### 7. UPDATE DOCUMENTATION
   **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Update docs IMMEDIATELY after completing feature!**

   **Update these files:**
   - ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**: Mark phase as complete, add test count
   - ‚úÖ **CLAUDE.md**: Update "Recently Completed" section and version history
   - ‚úÖ Add completion date, test counts, and files modified

   ```markdown
   Example update in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:

   ### 1.X Feature Name ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   **Completion Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
   **Tests**: XX passing tests (all passing)
   **Files Modified**: X files (list them)
   **Code Quality**: ‚úÖ All ESLint errors fixed, production-ready
   ```

#### 8. FINAL CHECKLIST
   Before considering ANY feature "done", verify:
   - [ ] ‚úÖ Tests written FIRST (TDD approach)
   - [ ] ‚úÖ All tests passing (100% pass rate)
   - [ ] ‚úÖ Zero linting errors in modified files
   - [ ] ‚úÖ Dev servers running successfully
   - [ ] ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
   - [ ] ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md updated
   - [ ] ‚úÖ CLAUDE.md updated
   - [ ] ‚úÖ No console.log or debug code left behind

### Common Mistakes to AVOID

‚ùå **NEVER** write implementation code before writing tests
‚ùå **NEVER** skip linting ("I'll fix it later" = you won't)
‚ùå **NEVER** forget to update documentation
‚ùå **NEVER** leave tests failing or skipped
‚ùå **NEVER** commit code with TypeScript errors
‚ùå **NEVER** use `any` types without explicit reason
‚ùå **NEVER** skip the "READ & UNDERSTAND" phase

### If You Get Stuck

1. **Tests failing?** Re-read the test error messages carefully
2. **Linting errors?** Run `npm run lint:fix` first, then fix manually
3. **TypeScript errors?** Check interface definitions in `types/index.ts`
4. **Feature unclear?** Re-read IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and DEEP_DIVE_UX_UI_RESEARCH.md
5. **Don't understand existing code?** Search for similar patterns in the codebase

---

## CODING GUIDELINES

### When Writing New Code

1. **Always check IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md first**
   - Contains detailed code examples
   - Shows exact file paths
   - Includes TypeScript interfaces

2. **Follow existing patterns**
   - Use Remix loaders for data fetching
   - Use Remix actions for mutations
   - Keep business logic in `/services`
   - Keep UI components pure (no business logic)

3. **Database changes require migrations**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name descriptive_name
   ```

4. **New Shopify permissions require:**
   - Update `scopes` in `shopify.server.ts`
   - Merchants must re-authenticate
   - Update app listing documentation

5. **Testing requirements**
   - Unit tests for services, using best Test Driven Development principles
   - Integration tests for Shopify API calls
   - E2E tests for user flows

### Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint configured
- Prettier for formatting
- Use descriptive variable names
- Comment complex business logic
- Include JSDoc for public functions

---

## SHOPIFY-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE

### GraphQL vs REST
- Use **GraphQL** for all Shopify API calls (modern, efficient)
- Avoid REST API unless GraphQL doesn't support the feature

### Webhooks to Handle
1. `orders/create`: New order created
2. `orders/updated`: Order status changed
3. `fulfillments/create`: Order shipped
4. `fulfillments/update`: Tracking info updated

### App Embedded vs Standalone
- DelayGuard is an **embedded app** (loads inside Shopify Admin)
- Uses Shopify App Bridge for navigation
- Must follow Shopify Polaris design system

### Rate Limits
- GraphQL: 1000 points per second (cost varies by query)
- REST: 2 requests per second
- Use bulk operations for large datasets

---

## COMMON TASKS & HOW TO DO THEM

### Task: Add a new Shopify permission

1. Update scopes in `app/services/shopify.server.ts`:
```typescript
const scopes = [
  'read_orders',
  'read_fulfillments',
  'read_products',  // NEW
];
```

2. Merchants will be prompted to re-authorize on next login

3. Update app listing to explain why permission is needed

---

### Task: Add a new database model

1. Update `prisma/schema.prisma`:
```prisma
model NewModel {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  shopId    String
  shop      Shop     @relation(fields: [shopId], references: [id])

  // fields here

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  @@index([shopId])
}
```

2. Run migration:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_new_model
```

3. Generate Prisma client:
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

---

### Task: Fetch data from Shopify

```typescript
// app/services/shopify.server.ts

export async function fetchOrderDetails(shopId: string, orderId: string) {
  const client = await getShopifyClient(shopId);

  const response = await client.query({
    data: `
      query GetOrder($id: ID!) {
        order(id: $id) {
          id
          name
          totalPrice
          customer {
            id
            email
            ordersCount
            totalSpent
          }
        }
      }
    `,
    variables: { id: orderId },
  });

  return response.body.data.order;
}
```

---

### Task: Create a new React component

```typescript
// app/components/alerts/NewComponent.tsx

interface NewComponentProps {
  alert: DelayAlert;
  order: Order;
}

export function NewComponent({ alert, order }: NewComponentProps) {
  return (
    <Card>
      {/* component content */}
    </Card>
  );
}
```

---

### Task: Add a new API route

```typescript
// app/routes/api/new-endpoint.tsx

import type { ActionFunctionArgs } from '@remix-run/node';
import { json } from '@remix-run/node';
import { db } from '~/db.server';

export async function action({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const shop = await getShopFromRequest(request);
  const body = await request.json();

  // business logic here

  return json({ success: true });
}
```

2. **WRITE TESTS FIRST** ‚Üí TDD approach (tests before implementation!)
3. **IMPLEMENT** ‚Üí Minimal code to make tests pass
4. **RUN TESTS** ‚Üí All must pass
5. **FIX LINTING** ‚Üí Zero errors before proceeding
6. **VERIFY** ‚Üí Dev servers, TypeScript, tests all working
7. **UPDATE DOCS** ‚Üí IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md + CLAUDE.md
8. **CHECKLIST** ‚Üí Final verification before moving on

### ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER skip reading these documents before starting work:
1. DEEP_DIVE_UX_UI_RESEARCH.md
2. IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

### ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER skip these critical steps:
- **TDD**: Write tests BEFORE implementation code
- **Linting**: Fix ALL errors before considering feature "done"
- **Documentation**: Update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and CLAUDE.md immediately after completion

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ALWAYS follow the phased approach:
- Phase 1 & 2 FIRST (pre-submission)
- Phase 3+ AFTER Shopify approval and revenue

### ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER implement features from Phase 3+ during Phase 1-2:
- No discount generation yet
- No automated workflows yet
- No advanced analytics yet

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ALWAYS consider:
- Mobile responsiveness
- Shopify Polaris design system
- Performance (some merchants have 100k+ orders)
- Internationalization (multi-currency support)
