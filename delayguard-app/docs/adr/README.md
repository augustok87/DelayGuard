# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the DelayGuard project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of a project. They provide context for why decisions were made and help future developers understand the reasoning behind architectural choices.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The situation that led to the decision
- **Decision**: The architectural decision made
- **Consequences**: The positive and negative outcomes of the decision

## Contributing to ADRs

When making architectural decisions:

1. **Create a new ADR** for significant decisions
2. **Update existing ADRs** when decisions change
3. **Link related ADRs** to show dependencies
4. **Review ADRs regularly** to ensure they remain relevant
