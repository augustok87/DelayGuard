rm -rf node_modules/.cache

npm run dev
```

## Test Results

### Test Suite Status
```
Test Suites: 70 passed, 1 failed (pre-existing), 71 total
Tests:       1174 passed, 1 failed (pre-existing), 2 skipped, 1177 total
Time:        ~22 seconds
```

**Note:** The 1 failing test (`optimized-database.test.ts`) was already failing before our changes and is unrelated to the UX improvements.

### Build Status
```
‚úÖ webpack 5.101.3 compiled with 2 warnings (no errors)
‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
‚úÖ Zero errors related to our changes
```

## Backward Compatibility

### Settings Data Structure
The original `AppSettings` interface remains **unchanged**:

```typescript
export interface AppSettings {
  delayThreshold: number;
  notificationTemplate: string;  // Still exists (ignored by UI)
  emailNotifications: boolean;
  smsNotifications: boolean;
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Alert Data Structure
The `DelayAlert` interface was **extended** (all new fields are optional):

```typescript
export interface DelayAlert {
  // ... existing fields ...

  // NEW (all optional - backward compatible)
  delayReason?: string;
  originalEta?: string;
  revisedEta?: string;
  notificationStatus?: { ... };
  suggestedActions?: string[];
  trackingEvents?: TrackingEvent[];
}
```

**Result:** Old data works perfectly. New data shows enhanced features when available.

## What You'll Notice

### Before Running `npm run dev`
- Settings had confusing "Delay Threshold" without explanation
- Fake "Notification Template" dropdown that did nothing
- Fake metrics (94%, 35%)
- Alert cards with minimal information

### After Running `npm run dev`
- Settings have clear section titles and explanations
- No fake dropdown
- Only real metrics displayed
- Alert cards show comprehensive information (when data is available)

---

## Next Steps

### For Development
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Navigate through the tabs
3. Create test alerts with the enhanced data fields to see all new sections

### For Shopify Submission
1. Take screenshots of the improved UI
2. Create feature media (video/images) showing the enhanced alert cards
3. Update Shopify listing with new screenshots
4. Submit for review
