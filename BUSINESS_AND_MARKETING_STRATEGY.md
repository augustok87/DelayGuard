# DelayGuard Business and Marketing Strategy

Last Updated: October 21, 2025

## Executive Summary

DelayGuard targets small-to-medium Shopify merchants to reduce WISMO tickets via proactive delay alerts. Freemium pricing (Pro: $7/mo; Enterprise: $25/mo) with a goal of $200K ARR in Year 1. Strategy focuses on organic acquisition (ASO, content, community), early affiliates, short-form video, and realistic CAC/LTV assumptions.

## Market & Positioning

- TAM: Millions of Shopify stores; focus on tens of thousands of SMB merchants with frequent delays
- Differentiation: Proactive delay prevention vs reactive tracking
- Positioning: Micro‑SaaS specialist—“We don’t just track. We prevent.”

## Pricing & Plans

- Free: 50 alerts/month, email notifications, basic analytics
- Pro ($7/mo): Unlimited alerts, email + SMS, advanced templates/analytics, 14‑day trial
- Enterprise ($25/mo): White‑label, API access, dedicated support, 14‑day trial

## Go‑to‑Market (Phased)

1) Pre‑Launch (Weeks 1–2)
- App Store listing copy and assets; pre‑launch landing page with email capture
- Recruit 10–20 affiliates (30% rev share for 12 months)
- Create 5 tutorial videos; set up TikTok/Instagram Reels; AI‑assisted content workflow

2) Launch (Month 1)
- Shopify Community and Reddit posts; Product Hunt for credibility; targeted FB groups
- Publish 2–3 content pieces/week; short‑form videos 3–5/week; affiliate pushes

3) Growth (Months 2–12)
- Comparison SEO content; referral program; email nurturing for free→paid conversion
- Gradually scale paid ads after organic learnings; iterate on creatives via swipe file analysis

## Channels

- Primary (organic): Shopify Community, Reddit, SEO content, YouTube tutorials, TikTok/Reels
- Secondary (paid after Month 3–4): Google Ads, App Store ads, retargeting
- Partnerships: Affiliates (YouTubers, agencies), complementary app co‑marketing

## Messaging Principles

- Lead with problem→agitate→solve (PAS). Emphasize reliability:
  - 99.8% tests passing, A‑ security, 35ms response time
  - “Set it and forget it” value; proactive alerts reduce tickets by up to 40%

## Metrics & Targets (Realistic 2025)

- CAC (blended): $13–18; LTV: ~$250; LTV/CAC: 14–19:1
- Year 1: 1,000–1,500 installs; 150–200 paid; $1,050–$1,400 MRR
- Short‑term: 50–100 installs first month with multi‑channel launch

## Action Checklists
