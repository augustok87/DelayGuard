## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach

#### **Unit Tests (70%)**
- Individual component testing
- Event handling validation
- Props and state management
- Accessibility compliance

#### **Integration Tests (20%)**
- Component interaction testing
- Redux state integration
- API integration testing
- Error handling validation

#### **End-to-End Tests (10%)**
- Critical user journeys
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Performance testing
- Visual regression testing

### Coverage Requirements
- **90%+ code coverage** for all components
- **100% critical path coverage**
- **Zero accessibility violations**
- **Performance budget compliance**

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Key Architectural Changes

1. **Event Handling**: React synthetic events → Web Components native events
2. **State Management**: Custom hooks for Web Component integration
3. **Styling**: CSS-in-JS → CSS custom properties + Shadow DOM
4. **TypeScript**: Full type support with `@shopify/polaris-web`
5. **Testing**: Web Components testing utilities

### Migration Patterns

```typescript
// Before (React)
import { Button } from '@shopify/polaris';
<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>

// After (Web Components)
import { Button } from '@/components/Button';
<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>
```

### Performance Improvements
- **20%+ bundle size reduction**
- **Faster initial page load**
- **Better tree-shaking**
- **Improved caching**

## 📈 Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
1. **DataTable Component** - Complex data handling
2. **State Management** - Web Components + React integration
3. **Event Handling** - Different event systems

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Feature flags** for gradual rollout
2. **Parallel development** during transition
3. **Comprehensive testing** at each phase
4. **Rollback plan** to React components
5. **Performance monitoring** throughout
